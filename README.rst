This repository contains development code and documentation for the DESI Bright
Galaxy Survey (BGS) Working Group.

To upload code you need to:
1) Make a fork from the main repository
2) Request a pull
3) Review and merge

These steps are detailed here:
https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/

Before you make the 'pull request' make sure you are not including temporary files, by adding a .gitignore file including something similar to:

*~
[#]*[#]
.\#*

Also, if you create a new folder, make sure to include a README.md file explaining what is stored there.
